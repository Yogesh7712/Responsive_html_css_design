                <p>While it is important to have naturally occurring sugars in
                    your diet, many foods contain harmful added sugars that contain
                    no nutritional value.  According to a study conducted by the
                    University of Florida, the brain releases heroin-like chemicals
                    called endogenous opioids when an individual indulges on sweet, salty or fatty foods.</p>

                    unhealthy snacks is simply because they donâ€™t consider
                    taking the time to source healthier alternatives</p>
